     <button class="accordion">Our Philosophy</button>
      <div class="panel">
      <p>


       At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with
        their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development.
        We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, playbased curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of
        educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a
        learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the whole child by:</p>
      <li>
        Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the
students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language,
discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them
      
      <li>
        Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple
        senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning
      
      <li>
        Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating
        opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group
        of peers
      
<li>
  Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses,
  listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they
  seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills

<li>
  Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students
  to become problem solvers

<li>
  Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the
  similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the
  unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.

<p>
  Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that
are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively
through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art,
writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into
account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of each child.

<button class="accordion">Visual Arts</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and
experiences include:</p>
<li>

 Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk </li>
<li>

 Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
and items</li>
<li>

 Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
<li>

 Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
<li>

 Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
<li>

 Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>

with specialists in these areas, in addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their
everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground. </p>

<button class="accordion">Extra Help</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
  an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
  meet students’ needs. </p>
 <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
  of ways, which may include:</p> 
  <li>
    
 Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking 
  process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
  <li>
    
 Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
  <li>
    
 Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
  <li>
    
 Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
  <li>
    
 Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
  order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
  <li>
    
 Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
  concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Parent/Teacher Conferences</button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
  students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
  group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
  informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
  and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
  Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
  curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
  child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
  read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
