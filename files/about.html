                        The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                        cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                        Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                        highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                        months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children
                        are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty,
                        staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the
                        community.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Children come from a variety of countries, cultures and
                        economic
                        backgrounds.&nbsp;The school maintains the high standards of the
                        National Association for the Education of Young Children, by
                        which&nbsp;it&nbsp;is accredited. It is licensed by the State of
                        Missouri.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                        development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                        University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                        assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                        nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’
                        presence enables children to receive additional individual
                        attention.

                        The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                        It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                        children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional
                        all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of
                        indoor gross motor play materials.&nbsp;A large outdoor play area
                        gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                        and play in the sand.

                    <h2> Our Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
        
                            The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most
                            effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children
                            act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process
                            more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for
                            children to interact with their environment in ways that are
                            meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that
                            reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
                            In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in
                            science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early
                            education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be
                            enriching for our program.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents
                            and personalities of each child and his or her family. A teacher’s
                            individual talents are also encouraged as she or he develops his or
                            her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant,
                            growing community of children, families and teachers.
                          </p>
